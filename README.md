### Hi there, I'm CharlÃ¨ne Bennevault, a Web developer ðŸ‘‹

After more than 6 years in eCommerce, working alongside developpers, I decided to switch careers and studied to become a developer myself. While before, I was advising companies on how to improve their online presence and customer experience, I want now to go further and help to build this vision.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some side projects using React to help some friends, while trying not to become addicted to CodinGame...
ðŸŒ± And because we never stop learning, I am currently finishing my CS50 Python and Javascript Web programming course and brushing my skills on React.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: if you have any questions, wants to collaborate please, send me an email at c.bennevault@gmail.com !
